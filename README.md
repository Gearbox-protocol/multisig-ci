## Gearbox protocol

This repository contains the code for middleware between Gearbox V2 and third-party protocols.

### What is Gearbox protocol?

Gearbox is a generalized leverage protocol: it allows you to take leverage in one place and then use it across various
DeFi protocols and platforms in a composable way. The protocol has two sides to it: passive liquidity providers who earn higher APY
by providing liquidity; active traders, farmers, or even other protocols who can borrow those assets to trade or farm with x4+ leverage.

Gearbox protocol is a Marketmake ETHGlobal hackathon finalist.

## Bug bounty

This repository is subject to the Gearbox bug bounty program, per the terms defined [here]().

## Documentation

General documentation of the Gearbox Protocol can be found [here](https://docs.gearbox.fi). Developer documentation with
more tech-related infromation about the protocol, contract interfaces, integration guides and audits is available on the
[Gearbox dev protal](https://dev.gearbox.fi).

## Testing

### Setup

Running Forge tests requires Foundry. See [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for installation details.

### Unit tests

`forge t`

### Mainnet integration tests

1. Start a Mainnet or Goerli fork with: `yarn fork` or `yarn fork-goerli`, respectively.
2. Open a new terminal window and run `forge t --match-test _live_ --fork-url http://localhost:8545`.

It is recommended to set `$ETH_MAINNET_BLOCK` or `$ETH_GOERLI_BLOCK` to run the tests on a fixed block. Mainnet tests can take significant time to run and can fail unexpectedly due to external provider errors. Re-running the tests on the same block (or without restarting the fork) will be sped up due to caching.
